## What is Owl?
Is a component of the Zuu framework designed to be stacked on top of Mink and provide all the juicy, _nightly_, experimental code in the new GraphQL stack ;)

## Quick intro
Everyone loves GraphQL... for many reasons. It solves many of the REST's problems (underfetching, overfetching, unwanted resorce access, unwanted resource fields exposure, the big number of reequest enpoints and many more...)

Developing GraphQL in TypeScript for the nodejs platform is a pain... Mainly because you have to write your types twice (your internal interfaces and also the exposed SDL schema [ if you don't know what i'm talking about, go learn GraphQL then comeback and continue ;) ]).

If there only was a cool piece of code that could transform those cool ESNext decorators (that TypeScript already provides experimental suport) to the SDL schema automagically... OH WAIT! THERE IS! That's exactly what owl aims at doing :) (and much more)

## Quick start
Will be updated soon....
